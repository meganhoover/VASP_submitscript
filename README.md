# VASP_submitscript
This submit script allows me to streamline my calculations. I am still working on having the geometry optimization loop stop once the convergence criteria is met &amp; the single point energy calculations starting. Currently, I have not been able to get the calculation to kick out of the geometry optimization loop once the convergence criteria is met.
